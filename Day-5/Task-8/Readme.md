# **📂 Recursive Directory Traversal**  

## **✅ What I Implemented:**  
- 📁 Used the `fs` and `path` modules to access files and directories.  
- 🔄 Implemented a recursive function to traverse all subdirectories.  
- 📜 Retrieved and printed the names of all files and subdirectories.  

## **❌ Challenges Faced:**  
- ⚠️ Encountered issues handling symbolic links and circular references.  
- 🚨 Faced permission errors when accessing restricted directories.  
- 🐢 Performance issues when traversing large directories with deep nesting.  

## **🎯 Key Learnings:**  
✔ How to read directory contents using `fs.readdirSync()` and `fs.statSync()`.  
✔ Implementing recursion to traverse directories and subdirectories.  
✔ Handling errors gracefully, such as permission and file access issues.

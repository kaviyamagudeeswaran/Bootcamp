### **🔗✨ Implementing a Promise Chain in Node.js**  

### **📚 What I Learned**  
- How to handle asynchronous operations using Promises in Node.js.  
- The concept of Promise chaining to execute tasks in sequence.  
- Reading and writing files using the fs.promises module.  
- Implementing error handling in a promise chain.  

### **🛠️ Implementation**  
- Used fs.promises.readFile() to asynchronously read a file.  
- Processed the file content (e.g., converted text to uppercase).  
- Used fs.promises.writeFile() to save the modified content.  
- Handled errors at each step using .catch().  

### **🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Script**  
1. Create an input file (input.txt) with some sample text.  
2. Run the Node.js script using the terminal.  

### **🔍 Additional Exploration**  
- Used async/await as an alternative to promise chaining for better readability.  
- Implemented logging to track the execution flow.  
- Explored handling multiple file operations concurrently using Promise.all().

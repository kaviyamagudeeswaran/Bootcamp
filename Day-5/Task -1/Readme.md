### **Command-Line Arguments in Node.js** 🖥️🚀  

### **What I Learned** 📚  
- Understood how to **pass command-line arguments** in a Node.js script 🖥️  
- Explored **process.argv** to access arguments from the terminal 🏗️  
- Learned how to **convert string arguments** to numbers for calculations 🔢  
- Implemented **basic error handling** to check for valid inputs ⚠️  

### **Implementation** 💻  
- Created a Node.js script that accepts two numbers as command-line arguments and calculates their sum.  
- Used `process.argv` to retrieve the input values from the terminal.  
- Converted the arguments from strings to numbers before performing the addition.  
- Added validation to check if the provided arguments are valid numbers.  
- Displayed the result in the console with a clear message.  

### **How to Run the Script** 🏃‍♂️  
- Saved the script as a `.js` file and executed it using Node.js in the terminal.  
- Passed two numbers as arguments while running the script.

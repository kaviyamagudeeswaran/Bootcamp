# **📝 Task 1: Filtering an Array of Objects** ✅  

## **🛠️ What I Implemented:**  
- 📋 Created an array of objects with properties like `name` and `age`.  
- 🔍 Used the `.filter()` method to find users older than 25.  
- ⚠️ Handled the case where no user meets the condition.  

## **❌ Challenges Faced:**  
- 🚨 Initially missed handling an empty filtered array.  

## **🎯 Key Learnings:**  
✔ How to filter an array of objects in JavaScript.  
✔ Using `Array.prototype.filter()` efficiently.  
✔ Implementing conditional checks for empty results.

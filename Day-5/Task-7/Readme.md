🌐 Simple Web Server with Routing
✅ What I Implemented
Created an HTTP server using the http module.
Implemented routing (/, /about, /contact, /api).
Set appropriate content types (JSON & text responses).
❌ Challenges Faced
Encountered EADDRINUSE error due to port conflicts.
Used node.http instead of http, which caused an import error.
Had incorrect JSON syntax in the /api response.

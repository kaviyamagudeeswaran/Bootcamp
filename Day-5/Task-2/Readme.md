Even or Odd Checker in Node.js 🔢⚖️
What I Learned 📚
How to accept command-line arguments in a Node.js script 🖥️
Using process.argv to retrieve user input from the terminal ⌨️
Performing basic mathematical operations (modulus %) to determine even or odd numbers ➗
Implementation 🛠️
Retrieved the number from process.argv 📜
Converted the input from a string to a number using parseInt() 🔢
Used the modulo operator (% 2 === 0) to check if the number is even or odd ⚖️
Printed "Even" if divisible by 2, otherwise printed "Odd" ✅
Included error handling for invalid inputs 🚨

Additional Exploration 🔍
Used isNaN() to validate input and handle non-numeric values ❗
Explored readline for real-time user input instead of command-line arguments ⌨️
Extended the script to check multiple numbers at once 🏗️

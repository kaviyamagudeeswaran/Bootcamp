# **🛠️ Building a Command-Line Tool**  

## **✅ What I Implemented:**  
- 🖥️ Created a CLI tool that accepts commands like `create <filename>` and `delete <filename>`.  
- 📜 Used `process.argv` to parse user input from the command line.  
- 📂 Implemented file operations using the `fs` module (creating, deleting files).  
- 📢 Displayed meaningful success/error messages to the user.  

## **❌ Challenges Faced:**  
- ⚠️ Parsing command-line arguments correctly for multiple options.  
- 🚨 Handling cases where the user provides invalid or missing arguments.  
- 🔒 Managing file permissions when attempting to create or delete files in restricted directories.  

## **🎯 Key Learnings:**  
✔ How to build a basic command-line tool in Node.js.  
✔ Using `fs` for file manipulation operations.  
✔ Implementing error handling and input validation for better user experience.

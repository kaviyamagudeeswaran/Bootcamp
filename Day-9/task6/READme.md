### **🎯 Learned:**  
⚡ **Performance optimization** using `useMemo` and `useCallback`.  
🔢 **Memoizing expensive calculations** to avoid unnecessary re-computation.  
🎭 **Reducing unnecessary re-renders** by memoizing event handlers.  
📊 **React DevTools Profiler** for measuring performance gains.  

### **🛠️ Implemented:**  
🔍 Created a **prime number generator** with an **expensive calculation**.  
🧠 Used `useMemo` to **cache the computed values** and prevent unnecessary recalculations.  
🎯 Implemented **event handlers** in the component and passed them to child components.  
⚙️ Used `useCallback` to **memoize event handlers**, preventing them from being recreated.  
📊 Verified performance improvements using **React DevTools Profiler**.
